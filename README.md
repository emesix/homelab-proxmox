# Proxmox-Based Homelab

This repository contains the high-level design, documentation, and service layout
for Vincent's Proxmox-based homelab.

It is intended as the **source of truth** for:
- Hardware and host roles
- Network and VLAN topology
- Service mapping (which VM/LXC/Docker runs where)
- Runbooks and architecture decisions

Most of the content lives under `docs/`, `hosts/`, `proxmox/`, and `docker/`.
